<center>Howdy! My name is Lasham, San Awng, and I’m currently majoring in Technology Management at Texas A&M University.
My current focus is completing my Bachelor’s degree in Science.
My everyday activities include going to school, playing soccer, watching television, and reading books.
I believe that commitment and passion are two factors that will help me succeed in my craft.
Aside from studying at the university, I enjoy listening to music and watching movies.
My long-term goal is to gain more experience, improve my career skills, and expand my network.</center>
