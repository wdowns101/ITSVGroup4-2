			<p style = "text-align:left" >My name is William Downs, I am currently enrolled at <a href="https://tamu.edu">Texas A&M Univerity</a> and majoring in
			<a href="https://catalog.tamu.edu/undergraduate/engineering/technology-industrial-distribution/technology-management-bs/">Technology Management</a>. I have been enjoying everything so far and I enjoy the work 
			the work surrounding the major. I am still unsure of what I am going to do after I graduate college. I'm sure I'll have a good amount of well paying jobs, I just need to put in the work. I would really love to
			work for a music gear distribution company known as, <a href="https://www.sweetwater.com/">Sweetwater</a>. I think with the skill sets I am learning here, and my passion/knowledge for music equipment, I 
			could work as a MIS Technician or a data scientist.</p> 
			<p style = "text-align:left" >I am also learning a lot of coding. I took a course covering C++, and I am now learning Python, SQL, and HTML. While I still have a lot to learn about these languages, I think
			they will be an excelent tool for me to have, and a great addition to my resume.</p>
